# Vilnius Coffee Finder - Feature TODO List

## User Accounts & Reviews
- Track user sessions.
- Allow users to sign up.
- Enable users to get discounts (mechanism to be defined).
- Allow users to leave custom reviews.

## Place Details Page Redesign
Redesign into sections:
- Summary / General Info (phone, working hours, address).
- Google Reviews section.
- AI Review section (from ChatGPT enrichment).
- Instagram posts section (requires integration).
- Shazams section (music identification, requires integration).
- Custom Reviews section (from registered users).
- Allow users to submit additional prompts for AI review (one per user, per place).

## UI/UX Enhancements
- Find and integrate a modern, simple, and slick Next.js UI template suitable for a rating/listing site.
- Implement a navigation bar.
- Enhance the front page (place listing):
    - Display more details for each coffee place, not just Google rating.
    - Add visual badges/icons for key features (e.g., has food, takeaway, good for working, outdoor seating).
- Implement advanced filtering options on the front page (e.g., by features, price level, open now).
- Add distance display from user's current location (requires geolocation).
- Implement a "Get Directions" feature (likely integrating with Google Maps).
